The website's colour palette is following closely to the BigBus Tours website. The red symbolise prosperity and good luck. In Asian cultures, red is a auspicious colour. Another reason of why red is being used is that it also symbolise the brotherhood ans equality of people in Singapore. In our VR, we have decided to use the front of the bus for the menu page, as we felt that it will give the user a fun experience.
